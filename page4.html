they'd climb and he'd unseat.</div><div>Every time they'd try the pass he'd leap off from the summit</div><div>To catch himself upon their mass — and both of them would plummet.</div><div><br></div><div>The army met in Riverhaven, the holy Temple filled,</div><div>And Mother Whiteburn, blessed maven, our piety distilled.</div><div>With arms upraised, she spoke of war, in Hodierna's prayer,</div><div>To gird our souls in light before we'd plunge into that lair.</div><div><br></div><div>What did I see then, standing tall, aglow with holy light?</div><div>Could it be, She heard our call, and came with us to fight?</div><div>Yes, listener, you won't believe the sight that I then spied</div><div>A Unicorn joined us that eve, to battle by our side.</div><div><br></div><div>Once below, I blew the horn to keep our party well,</div><div>That bell-like sound to strictly warn away the hounds of hell.</div><div>Perune in front, we traveled through the murky cavern pass</div><div>The darkness loomed, all light eschewed, within the vile morass.</div><div><br></div><div>We met the bridge and huddled there, our party well impeded</div><div>As only one could cross, with care, the rest of us conceded.</div><div>SHE whispered then inside our minds — I shivered down my back.</div><div>But she would grow, and crush, and grind, until our skulls would crack.</div><div><br></div><div>I blinked away that dire scream as blood ran from my eyes</div><div>And bellowed that the demon's scheme would end in her demise.</div><div>Around us then were bloody wraiths and shylvics breathing ice,</div><div>So to the test we put our faith and paid the battle price.</div><div><br></div><div>The unicorn reared and rushed ahead, its pearly horn ablaze,</div><div>And speared the foes with running head and scorching, holy graze.</div><div>It spared no rival of the good and cut down the Perverse</div><div>Who dared to ply their damned falsehoods and shore the demon's curse.</div><div><br></div><div>At last we made it 'cross the rift and built our first redoubt,</div><div>The healers wielding their fair gift, bearing all throughout.</div><div>I saw Szrael, Zymi, Aislynn, Kaelie, Qiyan, and Karthor</div><div>Shaking from the pain within, yet wading through the gore.</div><div><br></div><div>Ahead we found the demon's knight, a woman turned afoul,</div><div>Her skin all scaled with dusky blight, her voice a screeching howl.</div><div>She cried out then, 'AT LAST, SOME SPORT!' and fell upon our man,</div><div>Her plated wings in arched support, a great and chilling span.</div><div><br></div><div>Sir Samsaren, his axe held high, he led the forward charge</div><div>And Ciriasa leapt to fly and flailed into his targe.</div><div>She roared in fury, snapped her wings, and pushed him to the ground,</div><div>Then carved from him some fleshy strings and made a crowing sound.</div><div><br></div><div>But still he held, he held and held, knowing all the while</div><div>That for the demon to be felled we'd have to use our guile.</div><div>So while he held, the others stood and moved to find their stake</div><div>All praying that our tactic could the demoness unmake.</div><div><br></div><div>They each had vials, glowing soft, which held the healing tonic</div><div>And if they could but send aloft would cure the one cthonic.</div><div>But as they threw, she pitched and yawed to make them miss their mark</div><div>And cackled as she bit and clawed, our chances growing dark.</div><div><br></div><div>Sir Samsaren then set his gaze and drew up all his might</div><div>His magic put her in a daze and nullified her flight.</div><div>She crashed aground, now brought low, awash in her own bile.</div><div>Seldaren made the final blow — he nailed her with a vial.</div><div><br></div><div>We all rejoiced, oh glory day, we'd brought the demon down!</div><div>We showed her that our mortal way could keep her from her crown.</div><div>And so we fend our tiny place, Divinely brought to flower,</div><div>And prove to all, in this one case, the demon won't devour.</div></h3>
